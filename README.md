# Testing

Howdy!  I use bitbucket for free private git/hg repos for my various projects (including CityScout.us) but I wanted to get familiar with github. This area is for my personal testing and isn't really meant to be used, but (that said) you can always reach me if you have any questions about what I've put here.

The django-userlinks is close to something I have in production. I wanted to understand how to properly package django apps, and this was the first thing I did that used the Django "generic foreign key" facilities (ContentType + object_id as way to refer to an arbitrary row in an arbitrary table).

Thanks and happy hacking  ;-)
